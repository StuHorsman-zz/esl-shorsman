## Chapter 2

quantitive outputs  - continuos output (regression)
qualitative outputs - categorical/discrete output (classification), classed as {0,1} or {-1,1}
                      multiclass targets are defined by vectors of binaries {0, 0, 1, 0, 0}
                      
Input features can be expressed with $X$. $X_j$ refers to the $j$ element of vector $X$.
Output labels can be expressed with $Y$ if the output is quantative, $G$ if the output is qualitative. If $G$ has output {0, 1} then $G$ = $Y$ and $Y$ >= 0 | $Y$ <= 1 and is classified positive where $Y$ > 0.5



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
